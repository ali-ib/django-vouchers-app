# Django Vouchers APP

## Description
This is a simple stater django application which I used to get to know the framework for the first time.

## Installation
Clone this repo and `cd` into it, then run the following command to download the required packages:

  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After getting the packages ready, run the following commands to get the database ready:

```python manage.py makemigrations```
```python manage.py migrate```

You're ready now to run the development server using the following command:

```python manage.py runserver```
